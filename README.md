# Cedarwood Schedule Creator
This is the source of the temporary schedule creator I made for my boss.

## Techy info
* Data is loaded via scroll pagination
* All data is encrypted with AES (apart from the SQLite ids)
  * A salt is applied with this
* This uses [Caliburn Micro](https://caliburnmicro.com/) for depedency injection and MVVM
* This uses [Material Design In XAML](https://github.com/MaterialDesignInXAML/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit) for the design
